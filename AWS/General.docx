Cloud Computing Model
    IAAS (Infastructure as a service)
        Choose the hardware, operating system, network (e.g. VPC, Ec2, EBS)

    PAAS (Platform as a service)
        Manage application
        (e.g. RDS, EMR, ElasticSearch)

    FAAS (Function as a service /  Abstract services)
        Provides server functionality without having to manage server
        Examples: Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, SNS

    SAAS (Software as a service)
        A complete application for end users (e.g. gmail, salesforce.com, creative cloud)



(Geographic) Regions
    Availability Zones (two or more)
        Edge Locations (CloudFront CDN)

Geographic Regions
    Example: AWS GovCloud (US-West, Secret)
    Choose based on needs. Consider latency, costs, regulations, and services.
    Broken up into at least two Availability Zones
    Largest region is/ was US-East N. Virginia (seven AZs)

Availability Zones
    Example: TBD
    Physically isolated server locations
    Connected via high speed fiber optics
    If one location fails, AWS will connect to another (Fault tolerance)

Edge Locations
    100+ locations
    Caches content for high speed delivery to users
    Provides DDOS protection
