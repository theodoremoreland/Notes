Types of computing deployment:
    (Cloud computing is processing over the internet where the exact location of the servers is unknown).
    Public - AWS, Azure, GCP
    Hybrid
    Private (On premise) - You manage in personal data center


Cloud Computing Model
    IAAS (Infastructure as a service)
        Choose the hardware, operating system, network (e.g. VPC, Ec2, EBS)

    PAAS (Platform as a service)
        Manage application
        (e.g. RDS, EMR, ElasticSearch)

    FAAS (Function as a service /  Abstract services)
        Provides server functionality without having to manage server
        Examples: Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, SNS

    SAAS (Software as a service)
        A complete application for end users (e.g. gmail, salesforce.com, creative cloud)


(Geographic) Regions
    Availability Zones (two or more)
        Edge Locations (CloudFront CDN)

Geographic Regions
    Example: AWS GovCloud (US-West, Secret)
    Choose based on needs. Consider latency, costs, regulations, and services.
    Broken up into at least two Availability Zones
    Largest region is/ was US-East N. Virginia (seven AZs)

Availability Zones
    Example: TBD
    Physically isolated server locations
    Connected via high speed fiber optics
    If one location fails, AWS will connect to another (Fault tolerance)

Edge Locations
    100+ locations
    Caches content for high speed delivery to users
    Provides DDOS protection


SDKs, CLI Access, and AWS API
    SDKs (Python, Node, Java, .NET, PHP, Ruby, Go, C++, iOS, Andriod, React Native, Unity, Xamarin, etc)
        SDKs use http calls


Deployment Options
    All at once
    Rolling (a batch at a time), Rolling with additional batch.
    Immutable, two environments temporarily.
    Blue - Green
