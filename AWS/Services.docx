    Compute
        EC2
            Different price rates: 
                on demand
                reserved (contract terms) - upfront payments for predictable loads
                Standardized instances
                Convertible instances
                Scheduled reserved instances
                Spot (bid a price, price moves around) - for flexible starts and ends times, only feasible at very low compute prices
                Useful for users with urgent needs for large amounts of additional capacity
                Dedicated hosts (physical servers dedicated to your use (for legal reasons)) - great for licensing. Can be paid upfront for 70% of the on demand price.
