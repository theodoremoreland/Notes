Services
    Storage (Tentative)

        Elastic Block Storage (EBS) - ???
            A block of storage for AWS server
            SSD (general purpose SSD, provisioned iops SSD)
	        magnetic  (throughput optimized HDD, Cold HDD, magnetic)

        Elastic File System (EFS) - ???
                Network mounting file storage (EFS share and EFS mount targets)
        Storage Gateway - ???
        Snowball
            Physical device for uploading HUGE amounts of data (up to petabytes)

    Database
        RDS (MairaDB, Aurora, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle)
        DynamoDB
            Serveless
            NoSQL
            High speed, Low latency
        RedShift
            Petabyte scale data warehouse
            Based on PostgreSQL engine
        ElasticCache
            In memory access as opposed to on disk
            Can put a node in front of RDS instance to cache frequently accessed data
        Database Migration Services (DMS)
        Neptune
            Graph database
            Billions of relationships
            ms latency for graph queries

    Compute
        EC2
            Different price rates: 
                on demand
                reserved (contract terms) - upfront payments for predictable loads
                Standardized instances
                Convertible instances
                Scheduled reserved instances
                Spot (bid a price, price moves around) - for flexible starts and ends times, only feasible at very low compute prices
                Useful for users with urgent needs for large amounts of additional capacity
                Dedicated hosts (physical servers dedicated to your use (for legal reasons)) - great for licensing. Can be paid upfront for 70% of the on demand price.
