    Elasticity - The ability to automatically scale only when necessary.
    Scalibility - The ability to add, remove, upgrade, or downgrade resources to optimze performance or cost.
    Elastic vs Scalable - Scalable systems CAN change to meet demands, elastic systems WILL change.
    Elastic Load Balancers - 
        Network load balancer operate at layer 4
        Application load balancer operates on level 7 only.
    Auto Scaling Groups -
    CDN Networks -
            Edge locations - where content is cached.
            Origin - the origin of all the files that the cdn will distribute.
            Distributions  - the name of the cdn which consists of a collection of edge locations.
