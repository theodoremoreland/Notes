# Aurora

Amazon Aurora (Aurora) is a fully managed relational database engine that's compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL. With some workloads, Aurora can deliver up to **five times the throughput of MySQL** and up to **three times the throughput of PostgreSQL** without requiring changes to most of your existing applications.

The underlying storage grows automatically as needed, **up to 64 tebibytes** (TiB). Aurora also automates and standardizes database clustering and replication, which are typically among the most challenging aspects of database configuration and administration.

Aurora uses the Amazon RDS AWS Management Console interface, AWS CLI commands, and API operations to handle routine database tasks such as provisioning, patching, backup, recovery, failure detection, and repair.
