# A fully managed data security and data privacy service that uses machine learning and pattern matching to discover and protect your sensitive data in AWS.

 *Macie applies machine learning and pattern matching techniques to the buckets you select to identify and alert you to sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information (PII).* 

 ### Discover your sensitive data at scale

Macie automatically detects a large and growing list of sensitive data types, including personal identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses, and credit card numbers. The service also allows you to define your own custom sensitive data types so you can discover and protect the sensitive data that may be unique to your business or use case.

 ### Visibility of your data security posture

Macie automatically and continually evaluates all of your S3 buckets and alerts you to any unencrypted buckets, publicly accessible buckets, or buckets shared with AWS accounts outside those you have defined in the AWS Organizations.

Macie provides native multi-account support so you can view your data security posture across your entire S3 environment from a single Macie administrator account.


 ### Easy to setup and manage

Getting started with Amazon Macie is fast and easy with one-click in the AWS Management Console or a single API call.

Macie maintains a fully-managed set of sensitive data types, so there is no custom configuration required.
