# Migrate your databases to AWS with minimal downtime

AWS Database Migration Service helps you migrate databases to AWS quickly and securely. The source database remains fully operational during the migration, minimizing downtime to applications that rely on the database. The AWS Database Migration Service can migrate your data to and from most widely used commercial and open-source databases.

To start using AWS Database Migration Service, you need a replication instance which will be used to run your migration tasks.

When migrating databases to Amazon Aurora, Amazon Redshift, Amazon DynamoDB or Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility) you can use DMS free for six months.
