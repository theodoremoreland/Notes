Amazon GuardDuty is a continuous security monitoring service that analyzes and processes the following data sources:
* VPC Flow Logs
* AWS CloudTrail event logs
* DNS logs

It uses threat intelligence feeds, such as lists of malicious IP addresses and domains, and machine learning to identify unexpected and potentially unauthorized and malicious activity within your AWS environment. This can include issues like:
* Escalations of privileges
* Uses of exposed credentials
* Communication with malicious IP addresses, URLs, or domains
