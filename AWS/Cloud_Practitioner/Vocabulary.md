    Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) 
        Total cost of ownership (TCO) is an analysis that places a single value on the complete life-cycle of a capital purchase. This value includes every phase of ownership: acquisition, operation, and the softer costs of change management that flows down from acquisition such as documentation and training.

        There are three core components to Total Cost of Ownership/TCO calculations:
            Acquisition/Physical Hardware Costs
            Operating Costs
            Personnel Costs

    Elasticity
        The ability to automatically scale only when necessary.

    Scalability
        The ability to add, remove, upgrade, or downgrade resources to optimize performance or cost.

    Elastic vs Scalable
        Scalable systems CAN change to meet demands, elastic systems WILL change.

    Elastic Load Balancers
        Classic Load Balancer 
        Network load balancer operate at layer 4
        Application load balancer operates on level 7 only.

    Auto Scaling Groups

    CDN Networks
            Edge locations - where content is cached.
            Origin - the origin of all the files that the cdn will distribute.
            Distributions  - the name of the cdn which consists of a collection of edge locations.
            Web distribution - typically for websites
            RTMP - used for media streaming
            Objects are timed to TTL (time to live)

    CIDR block
        Classless Inter-Domain Routing. An internet protocol address allocation and route aggregation methodology.
        See also Classless Inter-Domain Routing in Wikipedia.
