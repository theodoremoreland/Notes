### Reliability

### Durability

### Scalability

Successful, growing, systems often see an increase in demand over time. A system that is scalable can adapt to meet this new level of demand.

### Elasticity

The ability to acquire resources as you need them and release resources when you no longer need them. In the cloud, you want to do this automatically.

### Elastic vs Scalable

Scalable systems will accomodate increases in demand by adding resources (typically more EC2 instances). Elastic systems will both add and remove resources relative to demand (think of a rubberband; it can grow and shrink in size).

### Elastic Load Balancers

Classic Load Balancer 
Network load balancer (operate at layer 4)
Application load balancer (operates on level 7 only).

### Auto Scaling Groups


### CIDR block

Classless Inter-Domain Routing. An internet protocol address allocation and route aggregation methodology.
See also Classless Inter-Domain Routing in Wikipedia.

### Resource Group

### Network Control List

### Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

Total cost of ownership (TCO) is an analysis that places a single value on the complete life-cycle of a capital purchase. This value includes every phase of ownership: acquisition, operation, and the softer costs of change management that flows down from acquisition such as documentation and training.
