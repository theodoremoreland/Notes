# Internet gateway (Connect to internet)
# Virtual private gateway (Connect to VPC)
# Direct connect (Dedicated pipe)
# VPC peering (Connect to other VPCs)
# NAT Gateways (Allow internet traffic from private subnets)
# Route tables
# Subnets
# Security Groups


# VPC Endpoint
A VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection.

# Clif notes
    1 subnet = 1 availability zone
    no transitive peering
    az names are random (regions are naturally not)
    aws reserves 5 ip addresses automatically per subnet
    you can have 1 internet gateway per vpc
    security groups can't span vpcs
    5 vpcs allowed per region

## Nat Instances
    disable source / destination check
    must be in public subnet
    there must be a route out of the private subnet to the instance
    nat instance size affects amount of traffic it can handle
    you can create HA with autoscaling groups, subnets in different AZs, and automatic failover script
    behind a security group

## Nat gateway
    preferred by enterprise
    5gbs to 45gbs
    redudant inside one az
    must patch
    not associated to secuirty group
    automatic ip
    always have multiple nate gateways and resources assigned to respective gateway

## Bastion Host
    nat instances and gateways are used to provide internet traffic to subnets
    used to securely admin ec2 instances using SSH or RDP
    you can not use nat gateway as a bastion host


## Network Access Control List
    you can associate a NACL with multiple subnets but not the other way around
    has a list of rules evaluated from smallest to largest

## Flow log

    not all ip traffic is monitored
    dhcp traffic
    traffic generated by windows instance
