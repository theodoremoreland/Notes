# AWS Well-Architected Framework


__"The Well-Architected Framework has been developed to help cloud architects build secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure for their applications. Based on five pillars, the Framework provides a consistent approach for customers and partners to evaluate architectures, and implement designs that will scale over time." - AWS__

## General Design Principles 

### Stop guessing your capacity needs
Take advantage of cloud elasticity.

### Test Systems at Production Scale
Create temporary production environments for the sole purpose of testing, then decommision them once the testing is completed. 

### Automate to make architectual experiementation easier
Avoid the time / costs of manually provisioning and confiuring resources. Take advantage of IaC to audit and revert changes.

### Allow for evolutionary architectures
On demand testing and automation lowers risk of making changes to systems and applications.

### Drive architectures using data
Collect data about your architecture to make fact based decisions.

### Improve through game days
Simulate production events to sports areas to improve and prepare organization.

## The pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework

### Operational Excellence

The ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures.

### Security

The ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies.

### Reliability

The ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions, dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand, and mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues.

### Performance Efficiency

The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.

### Cost Optimization

The ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.
