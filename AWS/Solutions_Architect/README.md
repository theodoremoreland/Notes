# AWS Well-Architected Framework


__"The Well-Architected Framework has been developed to help cloud architects build secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure for their applications. Based on five pillars, the Framework provides a consistent approach for customers and partners to evaluate architectures, and implement designs that will scale over time." - AWS__


## The pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework

### Operational Excellence

The ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures.

### Security

The ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies.

### Reliability

The ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions, dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand, and mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues.

### Performance Efficiency

The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.

### Cost Optimization

The ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.

# AWS Cloud Adoption Framework

__"AWS Professional Services created the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF) to help organizations design and travel an accelerated path to successful cloud adoption. The guidance and best practices provided by the framework help you build a comprehensive approach to cloud computing across your organization, and throughout your IT lifecycle. Using the AWS CAF helps you realize measurable business benefits from cloud adoption faster and with less risk." - AWS__

## The Six AWS CAF Perspectives

### Business Perspective

"The Business Perspective helps you move from separate strategies for business and IT to a business model that integrates IT strategy. Agile IT strategies are aligned to support your business outcomes, and they can adjust to business needs or technical capabilities as they change.

Common Roles: Business Managers; Finance Managers; Budget Owners; Strategy Stakeholders.

Capabilities:

IT Finance addresses your capacity to plan, allocate, and manage the budget for IT expenses with the use-based cost model of cloud services.

IT Strategy helps you take advantage of cloud-based IT approach to deliver value and end-user adoption.

Benefits Realization helps you to measure the benefits of your IT investments using methods for a cloud-based IT operating model.

Business Risk Management helps you estimate the potential business impact of preventable, strategic, and/or external risks." - AWS

### People Perspective

"The People Perspective helps Human Resources (HR) and personnel management prepare their teams for cloud adoption by updating staff skills and organizational processes to include cloud-based competencies.

Common Roles: Human Resources; Staffing; People Managers.

Capabilities:

Resource Management helps you understand and forecast new personnel needs for a cloud-based model.

Incentive Management helps you implement a compensation program that will attract and retain the personnel required to operate a cloud-based IT model.

Career Management helps you identify, acquire, and retain the skills needed for your cloud migration and ongoing operating model.

Training Management provides guidance on how to develop or acquire training for your employees so they can perform their roles in a cloud environment.

Organizational Change Management helps you manage the impact of business, structural, and cultural changes caused by cloud adoption." - AWS

### Governance Perspective

"The Governance Perspective integrates IT Governance and Organizational Governance. It provides guidance on identifying and implementing best practices for IT Governance, and on supporting business processes with technology.

Common Roles: CIO; Program Managers; Project Managers; Enterprise Architects; Business Analysts; Portfolio Managers.

Capabilities:

Portfolio Management provides a mechanism to manage it based on desired business outcomes. It can help to determine cloud-eligibility for workloads when prioritizing which services to move to the cloud.

Program and Project Management helps you manage technology projects using methodologies that take advantage of the agility and cost management benefits inherent to cloud services.

Business Performance Measurement helps you measure the impact of the cloud on business objectives.

License Management defines methods to procure, distribute, and manage the licenses needed for IT systems, services, and software." - AWS

### Platform Perspective

"The Platform Perspective helps you design, implement, and optimize the architecture of AWS technology based on business goals and objectives. It helps provide strategic guidance for the design, principles, tools, and policies you will use to define AWS infrastructure. The Platform perspective also includes principles and patterns for communicating your target state environment, implementing new solutions on the cloud, and migrating on-premises workloads to the cloud.
Common Roles: CTO; IT Managers; Solution Architects.

Capabilities:

Systems and Solution Architecture helps you define and describe the system design and your architectural standards.

Compute, Network, Storage, and Database Provisioning helps you develop new processes for provisioning infrastructure in a cloud environment. Provisioning shifts from an operational focus aligning supply with demand, to an architectural focus aligning services with requirements.

Application Development addresses your ability to support business goals with new or updated applications, and helps implement new skills and processes for software development that take advantage of the agility gained by cloud computing." - AWS

### Security Perspective

"The Security Perspective helps you structure the selection and implementation of controls. Following this guidance can make it easier to identify areas of non-compliance and plan ongoing security initiatives.
