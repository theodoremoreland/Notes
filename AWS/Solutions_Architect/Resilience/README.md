# Best practices


# Axioms
* Single AZ will likely never be the right answer
* Using AWS managed services should always be preferred
* Fault tolerant and high availability are not the same 
* Design with the assumption that everything will fail at some point

Highly available = System will always be up

Fault tolerant = Conceals any failures from users
