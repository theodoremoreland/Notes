# Versioning

Versioning in S3 is similar to version control in GitHub. S3 will save every version of an object such that it can be retrieved, restored, or deleted.

* Stores all versions of an object (including all writes and even if you delete an object).

* Once enabled, versioning can not be disabled, only suspended.

* Integrates with lifecycle rules.

* MFA can be used as a requirement for deleting versions (i.e. versioning's "MFA Delete" capability).

* Deleting the default version (i.e. by not specifying) will create a "Delete marker", this must be deleted in order to actually delete that specific version.

* Not all versions of each object are visible by default in the S3 console, the "Show" version tab must be selected (can be used to address specific versions, such as deleting, restoring, etc).

# Lifecylce Management

You can create "Lifecycle rules" for a bucket that will automate moving objects in the bucket into different storage tiers. 
Lifecylce rules can used in conjuction with versioning whereby you can apply differnet rules between current and previous versions for objects.


# Security

By default, all S3 Buckets are private. You must manully uncheck "Block Public Access" during / after creation in the "Set Permissions" tab to enable public access.

S3 Buckets can be configured to create access logs which are capable of being sent to other buckets (even buckets in another account).

Encrypts data as it's moving between servers.
* SSL/TLS.

### Encryption at Rest (Server Side)
