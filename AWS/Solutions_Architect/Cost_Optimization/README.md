### Pay-as-you-go

"Pay-as-you-go allows you to easily adapt to changing business needs without overcommitting budgets and improving your responsiveness to changes." - AWS

### Save when you reserve

"For certain services like Amazon EC2 and Amazon RDS, you can invest in reserved capacity.  With Reserved Instances, you can save up to 75% over equivalent on-demand capacity.  When you buy Reserved Instances, the larger the upfront payment, the greater the discount." - AWS

### Pay less by using more

"With AWS, you can get volume based discounts and realize important savings as your usage increases.  For services such as S3, pricing is tiered, meaning the more you use, the less you pay per GB." - AWS
