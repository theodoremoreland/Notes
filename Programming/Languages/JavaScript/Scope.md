block scope vs function scope


{{{}}} is valid JavaScript


let = block scope

const = can't change reference (constant), but can change values within complex data structures (e.g. objects, arrays, etc)


arrow functions aren't just shorthand functions, but the "this" keyword retains the value of the scope in which the function was definied as opposed to inheriting the value of the scope in which it was invoked!!!!!
